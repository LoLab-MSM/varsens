varsens documentation
==================

This package is to provide in Python a model independent method (i.e. the user provides the objective) function of doing Variance Based Sensitivity Analysis. It depends on the [ghalton](https://github.com/fmder/ghalton) package and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) being installed. The code is based on Andrea Saltelli, "[Making best use of model evaluations to compute sensitivity indices](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0010-4655(02)00280-1)", Computer Physics Communications 145 (2002) 280-297.
