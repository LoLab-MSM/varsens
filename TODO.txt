Goal: A general purpose variance based sensitivity analysis package
Objective: Saltelli's method with higher order terms

Must haves (absolute requirement for project success):

* A git repository for project on LoLab-VU
* A setup.py install for creating eggs
* A set of unit tests (nose) run from setup.py
* Full documentation in sphinx

Should haves:

* Scaling helper methods, linear, log
* Unit tests should utilize Sobol g-function
* Documentation should reference Saltelli's equations and paper throughout.

Could haves:

* Unit tests include documentation test
* A nice example as part of documentation that explains utility and meaning of results.

Would haves:

* Unit tests for more advanced models.

##################

To understand this package and the paper, you must understand the following:

* Statistical variance in data (and expectations)
* Identical and Independence Properties
* Monte-Carlo methods
* Low Discrepency Sequences, and how that improve efficiency of Monte-Carlo Methods
* With this, Saltelli's method becomes approachable.
