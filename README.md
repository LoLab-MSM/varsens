Python Variance Based Sensitivity Analysis by the method of Saltelli
-------------------------------------------------------------

This package is to provide in Python a model independent method (i.e. the user provides the objective) function of doing Variance Based Sensitivity Analysis. It depends on the [ghalton](https://github.com/fmder/ghalton) package and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) being installed. The code is based on Andrea Saltelli, "[Making best use of model evaluations to compute sensitivity indices](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465502002801)", Computer Physics Communications 145 (2002) 280-297.
